# Flask-Shards

Flask-shards extends flask to include the use of standardized blocks. This means that frequently occurring control elements and containers can be outsourced and used very clearly using custom tags. The entire functionality is contained in *renderer.py*. A simple example is implemented in *app.py* and the HTML files in the *templates* folder.
